- Aim is not to eliminate risk, but to reduce it to acceptable levels
	- EG, password not as a full hash, but sending as char 4 and char 7, dont have to send full password every time,just have to send a couple characters. stops man in the middle attacks, but means password is decryptable in th servers
		- this is fine however, beaccuse the main server is physically secured enough
		- not 100% safe but threat reduced to acceptable levels
- consequenses for a lot of cyber sec going wrong is reputation
	- impossible to quantify (unlike a building falling down)


- need to audit and create a policy for individual organisations
	- somehting they can actually achieve that can also reduce risk
	- no one size fits all for security bc of time, cost, skills etc

- Have to accept the risk and take precautions, eg backups, insurance
