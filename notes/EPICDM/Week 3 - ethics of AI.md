There is no such thing as AI, just clever programmers

## Dimensions of AI risk

- Time - AT developments - developing quickly
- Stakeholders - individuals, corporates, social groups, nations
- SEction - multiple industry sectors exhibit multiple and differnt risks
- Use Case - How AI is deployed
- Socio-Technical - Complexity of functional requirements

- Given enough time, a singularity may be reached, where ai can create new ai


### Stakeholders
- Individuals
- Corporate
- National
- Global

What sort of harm might AI cause to these people

### Sectors
- The risks of AI are dependant on the sector that it is being used in
	- It cannot explain the descisions it makes, or the bias it has in it

### Use Cases

### Socio Technical

- it will soon be that businesses cannot operate without AI

## REspobsible AI
### What is responsible AI

- Ethically sound, complies to regulations in all aspects
- Underpinned by a robust foundation of end to end governance
- supported by strong performance pillars addressing bias and firness, interpretability and explainability and robustness and security

- Martha Lane stewart wrote an article on AI about being responsible
	- Using AI for good

FATHER acronynm

### Complies with Regilations
 - There are not many regulations in AI because regulations take ages in the public sector And AI is moving comparitively fast.
 
``Regulators must also prepare for the changes AI will bring. We concluded that the UK does not need a new AI regulator, but that all regulators must adapt to the challenges that AI poses to their sectors. The Committee endorses the government’s intention to establish CDEI as an independent, statutory body that will advise government and regulators in this area.``

- Currently, the givernment recognises the role of AI in the economy, but the legislation and definitions are just way behind

- EU are proposing a load of regulations around AI: April 2021
- This is importnat becuase
	- if some contries have different regulations, then it will cause conflicts because of AIs inherant interneational links


- Security by design
- privacy by design
- ethics by design

#### Standards are not law

## End to end governance
- Teh scale of the AI is going to say how much governance The AI is going to need
``“AI Governance is the process of overseeing the responsible application of AI and its impact on all the relevant stakeholders (e.g., individuals, social groups, countries).”``
### Key Questins to ask

- Is it big? what is the scale of the AI development? Societal or Customer impact
- Is it strategis? AI principles, code of practice, polocies
- Is it a red flag? what are the inherant risks?
- Is a watchdog watching? - regulators - CDI
- Is it a novel approach? (worse bc it ahsnt been tested)
