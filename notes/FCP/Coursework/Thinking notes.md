#FCP #Coursework
Notes to self: 
- Keep it modern, clipboard artefacts, messenger artefacts, treat it as if u did the crime  
- RAM forensics in there  
- USB forensics in there  
- Ceaser cypher or convert all passwords into other than plaintext (leave hints)  
- Background image or shortcut fuckery  
- Abuse Public registry rather than a student one  
- We are allowed VM evidence within the VM itself (this could be RAM Forensics)  
- Hints could be in code? Or some kind of weird manner other than plain text Temp-mail.org or burneremail.com for fake email stuff 
- Use google takeout to download email artefacts 
- A video containing password (has to be extracted to be seen)
