2. Download a password manager - bitwarden
3. Download gimp
4. Download chrome/firefox
5. how to hide data inside videos
6. steganography
7. What is the standard price for fake IDs

8. Download libreoffice
9. Download Gsplit
10. Download skype

-------
### Set up programs
1. set bitwarden up and add password to it for Onedrive
2. sign in using the gmail account created earlier
3. GIMP setup and edit files
4. Set up gsplit and move zip to rubbish bin but dont delete it

### Recycle Bin
1. move .zip files from downloads into here and then empty
2. Then add more stuff to the recycle bin and dont delete it
-----
### Using programs

#### Gimp
1. Use gimp to make IDs and save them in a folder called 'For selling' inside the home folder for faye keide
#### LibreOffice calc
2.  Make a spreadsheet of clients with fake DOB and real DOB, link this with sending emails back and forth in emails
	1.  encrypt this document and hide the password inside the stegged video file

#### Gsplit
3. Split a file and send it in an email and maybe put the two halves in the same folder and call the folder email attatchments
	1. also steg the file before splitting to be extra mean


#### Thunderbird 
4. Have an email conversation with a colleague about transferring files
	1. Say "there's a cool video/image that I want you to see, but its too big o fit into one email"
	2. Then have the colleague reply with, oh you can use a file splitter
	3. reply with "theres something special inside the video too, cant say too much but you get what I mean"
		1. this links with the search for steganography
5. Have another email convo with an acomplice talking about how to fide stuff - veracrypt/truecrypt

#### Vera/truecrypt
6. Create a volume and put a load of fake bunny id images in it.
	1. could steg some data in some of them, but this wouldnt be that coherant.

### Side Quests

### Low level evidence items
 #### Level 1
 1. Text file with a mock up for a fake ID selling ad, just put in the documents folder and call it draft.txt
 
#### Level 2
1. Registry key with some evidence in, could be another place for passwords
2. take a screenshot of a map and image of a club like thekla or something and rename it to 'target.exe' instead of png

#### Level 3
1. Hide a file by changing the mft **(could be level 2)** because its still technically in the file system
	1. this could be done with hide and protect, but it looks liek windows 10 might not allow this, could be done under special requirements
	2. ``fsutil volume filelayout c:\$mft`` shows the size of the mft and where it is on the disk
2. ``https://www.easyuefi.com/index-us.html`` to store data inside the EFI/boot partition. This is technically still a file system of sorts, need to ask lindsey
	1. can probably only store text here, another password?

### Higher level evidence items

#### Level 4
- a load of the IDs in a veracrypt/truecrypt volume (could be level 5)
