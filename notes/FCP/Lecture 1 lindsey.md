## Ideas for whereto hide stuff
- in areas of the disk that user's cant usually see
	- maybe in the fat
.

## Develop a hollstic, not just technical viewpoint
- how has the user behaved?
- What aretefacts are generated byt his behavious
- What are these artefacts, what is their structure?
- How do the artrfcts link together through this beaviour?


# Creating a crime scenario - a developmental framework

- <3GB
- No illigal content
- <u> Readme  to accompany Encase image file</u>
- needs to provide a complete, coherent and logical scenario
- <u> all evidence items must be discoverable and readble using tools available to other students </u>
- evidence may be encrypted but must be possible to deduce via a rational deterministic process
	- what has been used to encrypt the file
	- the password or key from evidence

## Difficulty levels
1. Plain text or unencrypted image
2. ^^ but with deliberate attempt at hiding
3. plain text in other than file system (col. slack or bad clusters, could also be a zip file - not part of the file system)
4. encrypted data in a file
5. encrypted data held other than in the file system OR email file (.pst/.mbox) OR steganography
