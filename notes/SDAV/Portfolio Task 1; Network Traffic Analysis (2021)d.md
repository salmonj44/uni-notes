# Portfolio Task 1: Network Traffic Analysis (2021)


## Task

You have been asked to examine a sample of network traffic to investigate suspicious activity on some of the company workstations. The company directors need to be able to understand this data.

Your task is to produce a series of different visual representations to describe and understand the characteristics of the data. As a bare minimum, you should show at least 1 line chart, 1 bar chart, and 1 scatter plot. For each chart, you need to decide what data is useful for the chart representation, and how you can manipulate the raw data appropriately for this. You should then also provide a brief caption for each chart that describes what data is used, what the data shows, and what insight this may provide for furthering this investigation.
