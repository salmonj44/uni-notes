# BCH codes
- BCH codes form a large class of multiple random error correcting codes
## Vandermonde matrix
- A matrix in the form shown below  is called a vandermonde matrix
- a1, a2, an are distinct non-zero elements in a field

## BCH codes use candermonde matrix for parity checking matrix
- it can correct double error and detect triple error
- paritycheck matrix is below
- the first 2 rows are the same as H in the single error correcting code given last week
